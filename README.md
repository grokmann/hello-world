hello-world
===========

Hello, amigos!

I'm working on a project with a friend here now, and have decided to learn git, and GitHub, for realz. It's time to branch out of the TFS and/or manual versioning world.

I really like Lisps (e.g. Racket) and ML (e.g. SML/NJ) languages, and intend to create some non-trivial projects with them, which will probably live here.

Peace,
grokmann
